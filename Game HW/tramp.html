    <p>You gently prod the homeless man and he wakes up.</p> 
    <p>He isn't that pleased to see you until you explain who you are and that you are looking to write a story and wondrered if he had any stories to tell.</p> 
    <p>You offer to buy him lunch as a thank you if he's prepared to talk to you.</p>  
    <p>He agrees and talks about how he was a war veteran and how he ended up homeless.</p>
    <p>Do you write this story?</p>
