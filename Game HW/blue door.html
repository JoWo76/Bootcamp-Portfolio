        <p>This is the kitchen.  On the table is laid out the most magnificent spread of food.  
        <p>This is a strange turn up of events as it was thought that no one had lived here for years.</p>  
        <p>But before you decide to think about it much more yourealise that your stomach is growling and you remember that you haven't eaten today.</p>  
        <p>Surely no one would notice if you had a little nibble.  Before you know it you have stuffed in a whole baguette of bread lathered in butter and a lump of cheese and then started on the tray of chocolate chip muffins.</p>  
        <p>You gulp down some water and decide to have a little sit down. You start to drift off and before you know it you are fast asleep.  The clock ticks by and when you awake you realise you have completely missed the deadline.</p>
