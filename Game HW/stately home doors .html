    <img src="img/mansion.jpg" alt="derelict mansion">
    <p>When you arrive at the stately home you take the stairs up to the front door.</p> 
    <p>It is a well known building in the area and everyone knows that no one has lived there for years.</p>
    <p>You gingerly push open the front door and it opens without any effort.</p> 
    <p>Once through the door you find yourself in a great hall with large portraits hanging on the walls and three doors each a different colour.</p>  
    <p>Which door should you go through? Make your choice, click one.</p>
