    <p>As you get nearer to the park you can hear the mum's giggling about something.</p>  
    <p>You cautiously join the conversation and they are talking about how some of the parents have been turning up to school in their pyjamas to drop their children off at school.</p> 
    <p>They had been reprimanded by the headteacher for not setting a good example to the children</p>
    <br>
    <p>Is this a newsworthy story?</p>
