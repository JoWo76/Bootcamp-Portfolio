    <h1>THIS IS THE INVISIBILITY SPELL</h1>
    <img src="img/invisibillity.jpg" width="250" height="350" alt="invisibility spell">
    <p>You use the spell and you immediately become invisible.</p>
    <p>You come back out of the room and two men come barging past you from upstairs.</p>
    <p>They can't see you. You hear noises from upstairs.  You go up to investigate.</p>
    <p>You can hear whimpering from a room.  When you open the room you see a poor man bound up.  You quickly untie him.</p>
    <img src="img/tied-up-man.jpg" width="250" height="350" alt="tied up man">
    <p>It turns out he is the heir of the stately home and some burglars had  tied him up and run off with some of the silverware that was kept in the attic.</p>
    <p>Once you've rang the police and made sure that man is OK you could go home and write up this story.</p>
    <p>Do you write up this story or try another door?</p>
