    <h1>The Park</h1>

    <p>You keep walking through the park despite the numerous puddles left by the downpour of rain left this morning.</p>  
    <p>It really is quite a lovely day.  You spot a homeless man snoozing on a bench.</p>  
    <p>You can hear the chatter of children playing in the nearby play park and love watching the dogs run freely.</p> 
    <p>In the distance you can see the roof of the derelict stately home that used to be owned by Lord Farquar sparking in the sun.</p>
    <p>But you can't help still feeling stressed because you haven't got long to get that story before you don't have a job.</p> 
   <br>
   <p>You have three choices. Should you talk to the mums at the park and see if they have any decent gossip worth writing about?</p>
   <p>Or should you wake up the homeless man and see if he has any stories to tell.</p>
   <p>You can see the derelict stately home in the distance should you walk there and see if there's anything interesting?</p>
