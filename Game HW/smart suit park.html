    <p>So you turned left and now you are in the park.  The trees are gently swaying in the wind and the birds are singing.</p>  
    <p>It really has turned into a beautiful day.</p>
    <p>Oh no!!! there is a giant puddle in front of you and no way round it.  Oh dear you are going to have to go home and either change your shoes or go in a different direction.</p>
